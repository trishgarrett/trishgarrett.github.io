title:  "Ruby Simplified"

In a world where everything is extremely complicated, Ruby was meant to be just the opposite.  During a discussion, Yukihiro Matsumoto decided that we needed a truly simplified object oriented programming language.  Javascript, besides being frontend, was too complicated, and Python was not truly object oriented.  Out of this decision came Ruby.  Suddenly, a variable tag became whatever name that one felt was appropriate.  If your variable referred to small cars then your variable tag simply becomes small_cars = "whatever".
The difficulty in this is getting our poor, stressed-out, over-complicated brain to think more simply.  I know I have spent hours on one Ruby lab or another simply because I am overthinking the code.  I usually end up caving, asking for help, only to find out that ninety percent of my code was unnecessary, and probably the multiple hours spent working on said code was a complete waste of time.  
I would suggest that if you are struggling with any issue with Ruby code, step away from it for a little while, and come back to it from a completely different uncomplicated perspective.  It may mean that you will end up erasing your previous complicated work, but the end resul will hopefully (a) work and (b) be easy to read and understand for yourself and everyone else working on the project.
